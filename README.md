# StockDisplay
User Interface that displays live stock data 
This project is for personal use where I display live data on stocks that I am interested in and more importantly, I store notes for each stock, a feature that I am not able to do with other stock brokers. Having my own peronalized stock UI allows me better keep track of my investments

As of Nov. 12, this project just shows live data in the command line
