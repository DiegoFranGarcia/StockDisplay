# StockDisplay
User Interface that displays live stock data 
This project is for personal use where I display live data on stocks that I am interested in and more importantly, I store notes for each stock, a feature that I am not able to do with other stock brokers. Having my own peronalized stock UI allows me better keep track of my investments.

I also plan to connect my machine learning model from my Stock Market Predictor to this so that I can predict if a stock will be up or down the next day
